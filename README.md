This repository contains all supplementary materials for the paper listed above. It includes:

- Diagrams for each of the implemented networks including their dimensionalities for one of the utilized datasets.

- Code to reproduce the results of the experiments, to do so, use the unmixing_experiments_runner.py module with proper arguments.

- The detailed results of the experimental study (Wilcoxon tests, training and test times for each training set size and benchmark set, and the detailed metric values).
